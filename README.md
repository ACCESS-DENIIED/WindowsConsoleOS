A work-in-progress application that aims to convert Windows into a Console-like experience.

As of right now, this application is quite basic. I've only added the ability to navigate Windows' tabs/windows similar to how Alt-Tab or Windows-Tab works.
This program requires an Xinput device (Xbox controller, Xinput via DS4Windows, etc).

Instructions on how to use:

Hold L1+R1+Dpad Left to display the overlay and select from the available windows which one you want to bring to focus by navigating with Dpad up & down. 'A' selects the window and 'B' hides the window if you want to cancel.

◇ Confirm or Select a window to restore or bring to focus by pressing 'A'.
